# Phase Reference

This material acts as an introduction to Phase, which is much closer
to a tutorial than the [API Reference](/api). It also details the internal
workings of the library, which can be very useful if you're trying
to develop a companion library or just understand Phase better.

Both Phase and this documentation are still in alpha. Documentation
is one of our core goals, and we intend to have full coverage in time.
